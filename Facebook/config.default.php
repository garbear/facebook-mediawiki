### FACEBOOK CONFIGURATION VARIABLES ###

/**
 * To use Facebook you will first need to create a Facebook application:
 *    1.  Visit the "Create an Application" setup wizard:
 *        https://developers.facebook.com/apps/?action=create
 *    2.  Enter a descriptive name for your wiki in the Site Name field.
 *        This will be seen by users when they sign up for your site.
 *    3.  Choose an app namespace (something simple, like coffeewiki)
 *    4.  Copy the App ID, Secret and Namespace into this config file.
 *    5.  Make sure you set the Death Callback. See $wgFbAllowDebug below.
 * 
 * Optionally, you may customize your application:
 *    A.  Upload icon and logo images. The icon appears in Timeline events.
 *    B.  Create a Page for your app (only if you don't already have one).
 *        Visit the settings, click Advanced, scroll to the bottom and click
 *        the button in the "App Page" field. This will create a new page for
 *        your app. Paste the Page ID for your app below.
 *    C.  Customize auth dialog messages. See $wgFbAllowDebug below.
 *    D.  Defined Open Graph objects and actions. See $wgFbOpenGraph below.
 * 
 * It is recommended that rather than changing the settings in this file, you
 * instead override them in LocalSettings.php by adding new settings after
 * require_once("$IP/extensions/Facebook/Facebook.php");

/**
 * Special:Connect/Debug
 * 
 * This extension includes a program that configures your Facebook application
 * for you (how awesome is that?). Visit Special:Connect/Debug to begin. The
 * extension will detect fields that aren't filled in properly and will warn
 * you or indicate an error. Click on the warning/error icon and MediaWiki will
 * confirm the new setting. No further action is required on your part; the
 * setting has automatically been saved to Facebook.
 * 
 * The most important setting is the Deauth Callback. When a user removes your
 * application from their Facebook settings, the Death Callback lets Facebook
 * disconnect the user's accounts in the MediaWiki database.
 * 
 * It is OK to leave this special page enabled. To view this special page you
 * must have admin rights on the wiki (or be an admin of the Facebook group
 * below) AND be listed as a Developer or Admin of the Facebook application.
 * Set $wgFbAllowDebug to false to disable Special:Connect/Debug. Regardless,
 * make sure you visit this page at least once.

/**
 * Wiki pages are represented in the Open Graph as "articles," a built-in type
 * provisioned by Facebook. To include files uploaded to your wiki in the Open
 * Graph, register "file" as a custom object for your application in the Open
 * Graph Dashboard and define it here.
 * 
 * Optionally, you can register a custom object type for articles. It will then
 * be used instead of the built-in type. (As far as I can tell, the only
 * difference is that custom objects are preceeded by your namespace:
 * "NAMESPACE:article" as opposed to just "article.")
 * 
 * Depending on the extensions you have installed, several other object types
 * are available. These include "blog" and "badge."
 * 
 * If you registered and defined everything correctly, the Object Debugger on
 * Special:Connect/Debug should not show any errors.

 *    edit    = article
 *    tweak   = article
 *    discuss = article
 *    watch   = article, file
 *    protect = article, file
 *    upload  = file
 * 
 * You can rename an action by specifying a different value; leave an action
 * commented to disable it. The "tweak" action is used when the minor edit box
 * is checked or an edit is less than the MIN_CHARS_TO_EDIT constant (default 10):
 *    define('MIN_CHARS_TO_EDIT', 10);
 * If "tweak" isn't defined, "edit" will be used instead. Extension-dependent
 * actions inlude "rate" (articles) and "earn" (badges).

 * after the user has left your wiki, but is usually refreshed when the user
 * returns (this is why pages sometimes load twice - so the server can pick up
 * the new session). If the user changes their Facebook password or logs out of
 * Facebook, the session can only be restored by having them click a Login button
 * (either in the personal toolbar or a <fb:login-button> plugin). If the session
